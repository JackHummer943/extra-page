              Together with the kanvas dubai’s technical team, we discussed the show's format while
              also focusing on individual artist presentations. Since the art was intended to be
              projected on the walls and floor, it was critical to plan the “flow" and synchronise
              all artworks within the timeframe. So the timeline was created, additional effects
              such as sound and transitions were added, and we were finally able to see how the
              exhibition was coming together. kanvas dubai's digital team did an excellent job.
              Because the exhibition's theme was "Technology and Humanity Canvas," it seemed
              appropriate to include an AI voiceover to enhance the show's overall experience. At
              the end, everything was perfect.
