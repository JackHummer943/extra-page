              In the first step of the process, I went through all of the applications and selected
              the ones that were suitable and in line with the overall concept of the exhibition.
              Following the initial selection, we discussed various presentation ideas for each
              individual artwork, as well as the best way to create "the show," with the Vernissage
              team. Intense back-and-forth and many rounds of reviewing each application were part
              of this process. Following the submission of a few artists who were late, the final
              list was compiled and validated with the Vernissage team.

              Digital art exhibitions follow a different set of curatorial procedures than their
              physical counterparts. There is a distinction between the two. The magic of a physical
              exhibition (a traditional exhibition) takes place on the floor during the process of
              actually installing all of the artworks. On the other hand, the curation of a digital
              exhibition takes place on the screen of the computer. As a consequence of this, the
              final result can only be appreciated on the opening night of the exhibition; you can
              only see the "preview" and, if absolutely necessary, discuss the specifics with the
              technical team. One of the most fascinating aspects of curating a digital exhibition
              is the fact that it can be done from any location in the world.
